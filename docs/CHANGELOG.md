# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Entry example:

## [Version] - YEAR-MONTH-DAY

### ChangeType

- One change.
- Second change.
- Etc.

## Good practices

### Guidelines

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines!
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- Chronology inversed - the latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.

### Types of changes

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

## How to not get burned out

Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:

1. People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
2. At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.
