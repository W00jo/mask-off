## Game outline

*Mask Off* is a 2D, four-player arena brawler viewed from a static, side-on camera angle that keeps all the action on one screen. The game flows in fast-paced rounds across a variety of interactive stages.

### Gameplay

1. **Start:** Players begin in a "waiting room" lobby, then are dropped into one of three unique arenas.
2. **Combat:** Players use a simple set of moves (punch, jump, dodge) to fight each other.
3. **THE MASK OFF:** A timer counts down, and a single, powerful Mask spawns in a location.
4. **Power-Up:** Players race to acquire the Mask. The player who grabs it gains a significant, temporary advantage.
5. **Victory:** The round's victory condition is to be the last player standing.

With three maps to choose from, each having a modifier (or not), tons of easter eggs, charming art style, its just a big shame not to beat-each-other-up.

### Elevator pitch

Gangbeast if it was any good (jk).

## Character

Players in *Mask Off* control a simple, gender-neutral avatar. These characters are designed as "blank slates" with minimal backstory. Their purpose is to be a vessel for the player and, more importantly, for the masks they wear. Said masks are though full of references to titles, we treasure, love and are charmed by.

The core gameplay is designed to be simple and accessible, especially for play on a single keyboard. The complexity comes from using the mask powers, not from the basic controls.

**Core Actions:**

- Run, jump, and dodge to navigate the arena and avoid attacks.
- A standard punch and kick for close-quarters fighting. These are quick but do minimal damage.
- The primary gameplay mechanic is grabbing and automatically wearing a mask.

TODO

When a player wears a mask, their abilities are temporarily replaced. For example, the "Bomber Mask" might change the **Punch** actions to **Drop Bomb**. The controls remain simple, but the character's function in the game changes dramatically.

## Game World

The world of *Mask Off* is a series of vibrant, contained arenas merged out of our previous projects. Except for the map made for this game, they are homages with mechanics referencing our past work... or from our university! The game will launch with four unique arenas.

The player's journey through the world is straightforward and match-based. There is no overworld to explore. Players move from the game lobby directly into an arena for each match.
